Wrote a fixed size buffer to optimize the number of syscalls made when making multiple read and write statements. 

The myopen function opens a file and creates a struct which allocates memory for the read and write buffers.

The mywrite and myread functions act similarly to fwrite and fread: they write or read a specified number of bytes while keeping record of the number of bytes written and the resulting offset. 

The myflush function writes the remaining bytes in the write buffer to the destination file.

The myseek function, similar to fseek, resets the file position indicator according to the number of bytes and the state of whence.

The myclose function flushes and frees allocated memory.
